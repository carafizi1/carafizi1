### Hello. I'm Gabriel Carafizi, but mostly everyone calls me by my surname and i like it üíÅ

I'm a fullstack developer, working with e-commerces at ACCT, using VTEX infrastructure.
Currently i'm working using React with TypeScript & GraphQL at the front-end, and Node.js with TypeScript over Koa.js & GraphQL at the back-end.

But overall i'm always learning new stuff & contributing to opensource projects!
