### Hello. I'm Gabriel Carafizi but mostly everyone call me just Carafizi

I'm a fullstack developer, currently working with e-commerces at ACCT, using VTEX infrastructure and i mostly use React with TypeScript & GraphQL at the front end, and Node.js with TypeScript over Koa.js & GraphQL at the back-end.

But overall i'm always learning new stuff & contributing to opensource projects!
